# password-generator-js
I built this application with the purpose to generate a random password that is dependent on user-selected criteria. I created this application to function by clicking the Generate Password button which then triggers prompts for the user to select which character types and length they would like their password to be. The password length has to be a minimum of 8 characters or a maximum of 128 characters in order to generate a password. If the user length input doesn't meet the requirements set for password length the application will re-prompt the user to choose a password length between 8 and 128 characters long. Once user input is collected the application functions by randomizing the character types and order meeting the user's selected password length. Finally, the generated password displays in the text box.
